        <p>About TED</p>
        <p>TED is a nonprofit organization dedicated to spread ideas, since 1984. The annual TED Conference invites the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak in short and powerful talks (18 minutes top). These talks are then made available, for free, at TED.com. This way, every person, from vastly different fields and unlikely places, can mingle and draw inspiration. 
        In the spirit of “ideas worth spreading”, TED has created a program called TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events that bring communities or organizations together to share a TED-like experience.
